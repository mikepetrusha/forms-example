# The Ultimate Form Abstraction

This is the final demo of my blog post [The Ultimate Form Abstraction](http://brendonovich.dev/blog/ultimate-form-abstraction). Check src/App.tsx for the completed form.

This demo has a few things that were not covered in the post:

- Path aliases: Thanks to `vite-tsconfig-paths` and the `paths` entry in `tsconfig.json`, ui & form components are imported from `~/ui` and `~/forms`.
- Styling: Unocss and clsx are being used
